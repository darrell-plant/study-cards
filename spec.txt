I've tested our recent changes and all look good. Committed to git.

Now there is another change we need... 

We require a car-mode toggle on the main screen (input card screen). This is so we can have different rules/defaults in car and non-car mode.

In non-car-mode, never switch to single panel view.
In car-mode, switch to single panel view at 2.2rem.
Toggling from non-car-mode to car-mode should reset the font size to 2.6rem
Toggling from car-mode to non-car-mode should reset the font size to 2.0rem

Car mode toggle icon should be located on the main screen to the right of "marqueeBtnStart"
The icon ahould be a car when in car mode and a house when in non-car-mode

In car-mode set background color to #570f06
In non-car-mode set background color to #121922

On app start, default to non-car-mode. Do not persist car-mode status.
